 *
 * @brief This group contains the generic GPIO API, which presents a GPIO
 *   controller as a device node driven by ioctl() calls.
 *
 * A controller is a driver in the BSP, which owns the pins: how a pin is
 * muxed and whether the board permits it to be used at all are the BSP's to
 * decide.  Pins are numbered logically, 0 to rtems_gpio_info::pin_count - 1
 * with no holes, and the driver maps them to whatever the silicon calls them.
 *
 * A driver need not implement everything.  A handler left NULL is reported as
 * ENOTSUP, so a controller that can only read and write pins is legal.
 *
 * The rtems_gpio_*() functions below are the supported interface.  Each is
 * one ioctl() on the node, and the command numbers are published so that a
 * caller which already holds a descriptor is not forced to use them.
